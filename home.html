                In the city of Montreal, high density living is the name of the game for developers. Montreal condos for
                rent are spread out across the whole island and vary from large buildings to small quad-plexes in quiet
                neighbourhoods. Ask the owner about their expectations before you move in.

            <p class="prop_type_text">As a big city, Montreal is pretty unique in how its neighbourhoods are built.
                Rather than tons of large apartment buildings, there are many smaller Montreal townhouses for rent in
                quaint areas deep in the heart of the city. Look in enclaves like Westmount or neighbourhoods like
                Lasalle to start your search.</p>

                city in residential neighbourhoods. Smaller and cheaper than single family homes, duplexes are great
                options for young families on a budget. You can even find some with garages and private driveways.</p>
